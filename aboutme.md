My name is Yong Zhi Tan, and I am currently a third year student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign! I am a Computer Engineering student with an interest in computer systems. I aim always looking to learn about new and exciting aspects of Computer Science and Engineering!

I was born and raised in the sunny island of Singapore, where I hold many fond memories.

In contrast, I attended college in the bitter cold Midwest at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where temperatures drop [well below freezing](https://www.weather.gov/lot/RecordColdJan2019#:~:text=The%20coldest%20temperature%20in%20Chicago,31%C2%B0%20on%20January%2031).
